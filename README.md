# HazelcastProject
This project demonstrates basic operations on a Hazelcast map using a Java client. It showcases how to connect to a Hazelcast cluster, put a large number of objects into a map, and retrieve them.

Hazelcast's Failover Mechanism  

Hazelcast offers robust failover capabilities to ensure data availability and application continuity in case of node failures. Here's a breakdown of its key mechanisms:  
1. Distributed Data Partitioning:  Data is evenly distributed across cluster nodes, creating replicas and preventing a single point of failure. Partitioning strategies (e.g., random, key-based) determine how data is spread across nodes.

2. Member Failure Detection:  Hazelcast actively monitors the health of each node using heartbeats. If a node doesn't respond within a set timeframe, it's considered failed.

3. Data Rebalancing:  When a node fails, its data partitions are automatically migrated to remaining healthy nodes. This ensures data consistency and avoids data loss.

4. Client Redirection:  Clients are notified of cluster topology changes through Hazelcast's discovery mechanism. Clients automatically reconnect to available nodes, minimizing application downtime.

5. Backup Copies (Optional):  Hazelcast allows you to configure backups for data partitions. Backups are stored on other nodes, providing an additional layer of redundancy. In case a primary node fails, the data can be quickly retrieved from the backup.

6. Partition Migration (Even During Normal Operation):  Hazelcast can redistribute data partitions even when all nodes are operational. This helps balance load across the cluster and prevent bottlenecks.

Hazelcast in Action During Failover:  
Node Failure: A Hazelcast node fails due to hardware or software issues. 
Detection: Other nodes detect the failure through missed heartbeats. 
Data Rebalancing: Data partitions owned by the failed node are automatically migrated to remaining healthy nodes. 
Client Redirection: Hazelcast clients are informed about the updated cluster topology. 
Client Reconnection: Clients automatically reconnect to available nodes, potentially with a brief interruption.
Backup Recovery: If backups are configured, data can be retrieved from the backup node to maintain consistency. 

Benefits of Hazelcast Failover:  

High Availability: Data remains available even during node failures. 
Minimal Downtime: Clients automatically reconnect to maintain application continuity. 
Data Consistency: Data rebalancing and backups ensure data integrity. 
Scalability: Failover mechanisms work seamlessly as you add or remove nodes from the cluster.
